# Mobius_OpenSource

This repository contains the source code for the Mobius drug discovery chemistry database system. The primary goal of Mobius is to support multiple drug-discovery projects by  integrating and providing a set of tools for searching, analyzing and reporting on a broad range of public and proprietary chemistry-centered drug discovery data. The sorts of data commonly integrated in Mobius databases include chemical structure collections, in-vitro, in-vivo and in-silico compound data

Mobius and its previous incarnations (Cousin, ChemLink) which have all been based on a common set of design concepts, have been used internally at multiple commercial drug discovery organizations since the late 1970s.
