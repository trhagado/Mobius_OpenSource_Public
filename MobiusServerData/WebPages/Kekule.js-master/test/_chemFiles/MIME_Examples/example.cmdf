NOTE
Paragonite is a mica mineral, somewhat similar to muscovite; the two
minerals differ, however, in that paragonite contains sodium, rather
than potassium. This results in a smaller unit cell. The principal
polytype of paragonite is monoclinic, 2M1. 

At room-T, there is a very limited solid solution of paragonite in
muscovite, and of muscovite in paragonite - but the amount increases
with temperature up to about 10 and 20 percent, respectively.
Paragonite may be formed by the reaction: 

     kaolinite + albite -> paragonite + quartz + water 

it may also be formed in sedimentary low-temperature environments from
illite or montmorillonite. 

The optical properties of paragonite and muscovite are very similar,
and the two minerals can be distinguished by chemical analysis for
alkalis, or by x-ray diffraction. 

Paragonite usually occurs as fine-grained aggregates, along with other
Al-rich minerals. It is widespread in metamorphic rocks (schists,
phyllites, gneisses), mainly ranging from greenschist to the
sillimanite zone of the amphibolite facies, but it also occurs in
blueschist-facies rocks. It is found also in fine-grained sedimentary
rocks.
