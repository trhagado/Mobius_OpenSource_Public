<p>Chemists are often need to insert or edit molecules in net forums or web chat services. Unfortunately, online web rich text editors lacks that function. Kekule.js now provides the possibility to be integrated with other online editors. To illustrate that, a Kekule.js plugins for  CKEditor -- a well-known and commonly used web editor is built. You may need only two steps to enable Kekule.js plugin to work.</p>
<p>1. Copy the plugins directory (under _extras/CKEditorPlugins/ of Kekule.js files) to plugins directory of CKEditor (e.g., ckeditor/plugins).</p>
<p>2. Modify config.js in CKEditor root directory, adding the following line to the tail of the wrapper function:</p>
<pre class="CodeBlock">
config.extraPlugins = 'kekule';</pre>
<p>Afterward, an extra button to insert or edit chem object will be added to editor. Just enjoy it.</p>
