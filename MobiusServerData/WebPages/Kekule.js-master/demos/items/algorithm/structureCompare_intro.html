<p>Comparing two molecules to check if they are in the same structure is a common task in for chemists. Kekule includes a easy-to-use method to accomplish that. For instance, if you want to compare molecule A (molA) and  molecule B (molB), the following JavaScript code can be used (note: both A and B should be instance of Kekule.StructureFragment):</p>
<pre class="CodeBlock">
var same = molA.equalStructure(molB);</pre>
